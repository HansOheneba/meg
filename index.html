When I told you I was disappointed, it wasn‚Äôt really about you. It was about me and how I‚Äôve managed to mess things up. Lately, I‚Äôve felt like maybe you deserve someone better than me. <br> Someone who can give you everything, because you deserve it. Honestly it has been on my mind a lot, I really feel like I am not treating you fairly, but now I realized that instead of thinking you should get someone else better I really feel I need to become that better because if I don't I'll never grow. So I am going to be that better person <strong>for you.</strong> I don't know how I will do, but I am willing to give it a shot. <br><br> I know things haven‚Äôt been easy, and I know things have not been that easy for you. <br> And I know you do not want to do anything with me anymore but I want to change that. You deserve a boyfriend who takes you out, who treats you like you‚Äôre the most important person in his world. And while I may not be able to do all the things I want to do for you right now, I‚Äôm going to try. You‚Äôre worth it, Meg. <br><br> I just want to make things right and show you how much you mean to me. Thank you for everything, and I hope we can find our way back to something beautiful together. </p> </div>
